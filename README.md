# Price Predictor: Web Scraping and Machine Learning for Peugeot Cars

## Overview

This project aims to develop a price predictor for Peugeot 206 Type 2 using a combination of web scraping and machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the price of Peugeot 206 Type 2 cars based on various features.

## Implementation

The implementation details of this project are outlined below:

### Problem Statement

The project involves training a machine learning model to predict the price of Peugeot 206 Type 2 cars. The challenge lies in obtaining relevant data for model training, which is achieved through web scraping techniques.

### Data Collection

Data collection is performed by scraping car sales advertisements from Divar Web Site (www.divar.com). Various features such as year, mileage, color, etc., are extracted from these advertisements to create a comprehensive dataset.

### Data Preprocessing

The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. This ensures that the dataset is clean and suitable for model training.

### Model Training

Machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed dataset to predict the price of Peugeot 206 cars. Different algorithms and techniques are explored to identify the best-performing model.

### Model Evaluation

The trained models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess their performance and accuracy in predicting car prices.

### Model Deployment

The final trained model is deployed and integrated into a script that takes car information as input and predicts the price suggested by the seller. This allows users to determine whether the suggested price is reasonable or not.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements and future directions for the project are discussed, including refining the model, expanding the dataset, and exploring additional features for improved prediction accuracy.
